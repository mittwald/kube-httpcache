# 1.6

- Varnish 6.5.x support ([#64](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/pull/64) @johanneswuerbach)
- Update github.com/prometheus/client_golang dependency to v1.9.0
- Remove GOARCH=386 builds from releases
- Start building releases with go 1.15.6

# 1.5.2

- Fix metric names and missing labels for file cache metrics ([#55](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/pull/55) @thedustin)
- Fix scraping for Varnish 3.x. Removes the `main_n_ban` grouping. Metrics will now have individual `bans_<type>` metrics instad of the grouped metric that had `type` as a label. ([#51](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/pull/51) @glennslaven)
  - If you previously updated to 1.5 your exports would have already been broken as the grouping tries to combine gauge and counter metrics, which is not allowed by Prometheus.
  - This is breaking change if you are using Varnish 3.x and use ban metrics in your dashboards, you'll need to update them to the new ones.
- Clean exported backend name if beginning with reload\_ ([#56](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/pull/56) @stromnet)

# 1.5.1

- Fix incorrectly typing Varnish 4.0.x stat flag `a` metrics as gauges instead of counters. ([#48](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/pull/48) @glennslaven)
- Fix `-test` mode to wait for full metrics scrape before continuing.

# 1.5

- Deprecate `-no-exit`. Default behavior is now not to exit on scrape errors as it should be for a long running HTTP server.
  - This was design misstep. You will now get a deprecation warning if you pass `-no-exit` but the process behaves as before.
  - New explicit `-exit-on-errors` has been added for users who want the old default behavior back.
- Correctly export gauge and counter types from `varnishstat` output `type` property.
- Add go module support.
- Use `github.com/prometheus/client_golang` v1.0.0
- Start building releases with go 1.12.6

# 1.4.1

- `-docker-container-name` to signal that `varnishstat` should be ran in a docker container with `docker exec <container-name>` .
- Support Varnish 6.0.0 by testing the main logic works and metrics are exported.
- Start building releases with go 1.10.3

# 1.4

- Standard non Varnish prometheus metrics need to now be enabled with `-with-go-metrics`. Before they were included by default. Now dropped to export less clutter that majority of users will never need (@nipuntalukdar).
- Fix `varnish_backend_up` with Varnish 4.0 and earlier versions.

# 1.3.4

- New per backend metric `varnish_backend_up` with 1/0 value that reflects the latest health probe result. The Varnish bitmap uint64 `varnish_backend_happy` as a prometheus float metric was not that useful in detecting latest up/down per backend.
- Ability to give custom path to varnishstat with `-varnishstat-path` (@zstyblik)
- Github releases now include Grafana dashboards archive. This includes all the dashboards posted by users in the repo, starting with my own.

# 1.3.3

- New `-no-exit` mode that does not exit the process if varnish is not running at the time of startup.
- Support Varnish 5.2 [that removed](http://varnish-cache.org/docs/5.2/whats-new/upgrading-5.2.html#other-changes) `type` and `ident` properties from varnishstat JSON output. If `ident` is not present, it is now parsed from the metric name.
- Add tests to run scrape on static json files.
- Start building releases with go 1.9.1

# 1.3.2

- Update readme to mention that exporter has been tested to work against Varnish 5.x releases.
- Start building releases with go 1.9

# 1.3.1

- Don't return a 400 for `/` to behave more like other Prometheus exporters out there. Can now be used for health checks. ([#15](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/pull/15))
- Start building releases with go 1.8

# 1.3

- Release packages now use the same naming and internal structure scheme with [promu](https://github.com/prometheus/promu).
  - Fixes issues running this exporter with systems like [puppet-prometheus](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-prometheus)
- No code changes
- Start building releases with go 1.7.5

# 1.2

- Fix VBE label inconsistencies by always having `backend` and `server` labels present. ([#5](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/issues/5) [#8](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/issues/8))
- Resulted in varnish reporting lots of errors for a while after VCL reloads.
- Fix bugs in `backend` and `server` label value parsing from VBE ident. ([#5](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/issues/5) [#8](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/issues/8))
- Add travis-ci build and test integration. Also auto pushes cross compiled binaries to github releases on tags.

# 1.1

- `-web.health-path <path>` can be configured to return a 200 OK response, by default not enabled. [#6](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter/pull/6)
- Start building releases with go 1.7.3

# 1.0

- First official release
- Start building releases with go 1.7.1
